# Stack Data Structure

## What is a Stack?

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Think of it like a stack of plates - you can only add or remove plates from the top. The last plate you put on (push) will be the first one you take off (pop).

## Key Operations

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack
- **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack
- **Peek/Top**: View the top element without removing it
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty

## Brief Introduction

To get a deep understanding of stacks, watch this excellent NeetCode video:

## Common Use Cases

1. **Function Call Stack**: Managing function calls and their local variables
2. **Undo/Redo Operations**: Tracking history of actions in applications
3. **Browser History**: Managing back/forward navigation
4. **Expression Evaluation**: Parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions
5. **Valid Parentheses**: Checking for balanced brackets in code

## Interactive Playground

Try implementing a stack in Python! The playground below provides a template where you can code your own stack implementation. You'll learn by doing!

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Push      | O(1)            |
| Pop       | O(1)            |
| Peek      | O(1)            |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            |

## Practice Problems

To master stacks, try these popular LeetCode problems:

1. [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
2. [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
3. [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

## Tips for Implementation

1. Always check if the stack is empty before popping
2. Consider edge cases in your implementation
3. Think about size limits if using array implementation
4. Remember that peek operation should not modify the stack

Remember: Understanding stacks is crucial for both coding interviews and real-world applications. Take time to practice with the interactive playground above!
