# Introduction - CodeCraft Platform

Welcome, if this is your first tim at CodeCraft. This is a simple website to learn the basics of data structures, algorithms and advance your computer science journey.
This serves as a platform to gradually start from basic data structures and eventually reach more complex concepts as you move through your college career.

## How to use CodeCraft

I built this platform so that you can track your progression from a novice CS student to a person who has identified their interest. These concepts in my opinion are the gateway to understanding anything and more importantly foundational for getting a job, doing [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and the whole nine yards.
So what should you focus on when everything seems vast, AI seemingly does everything you want to.

- **Focus on the fundamentals**: Pick a coding language and build reps.
- Use CodeCraft as a hub to establish a **Mental Model** of all data structures you need in your back pocket.
- CodeCraft is just a **introduction** and a window into these concepts.
- Practice these questions, explore concepts in depth.
- Setup an **IDE**, or Integrated Development Environment to build off small examples and eventuall great software.

## Setting up a Development Environment

### Operating System Choice

According to me, the best OS for a developer is Linux based. This would be MacOS in the case of Apple users and Ubuntu in case of Linux Users. If you are using Windows then I would highly recommend you to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to get the best of both worlds.

### IDE or Integrated Development Environment

IDE or an Integrated Development Environment provides a code editing experience that is more efficient than a text editor. So an IDE is more than writing code on notepad, sice you get features like Code Completion and other Developer Tools.
With AI and AI enabled development, these tools become even more powerful and integrated into your code editor. Code Editor is a way of writing code, instlling dependencies, running code, debugging code, etc.and compilers is still very much a task upto the developer.
So for instance if you want to run python code, you need to install python and then run the code. If you want to write code in C, then you need to install the C compiler and then run your code using that compiler.

To Start with, I would recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it is free and open source. A simple google search will then give you instructions on downloading python and C environments.


### Online IDEs

Online IDEs are a great way to start coding without the need to install any software. They are also a great way to learn coding.

CodeCraft is aimed to provide a lightweight Online IDE experience to get started with coding and omit the boring parts of installing software and dependencies. It is totally upto you, either setup an environment, which will take time and effort but will help you understand a lot of things about software installation. If you are not in the mood to do the installation then happily visit CodeCraft and learn the concepts listed.
Use it as a introduction or a summary for the concepts listed. This is not exhaustive and is not a replacement for a good book or a course. Codecraft provides you different languages and concepts and these are similar to an index of a book.



## Chapters

Check out the following chapters to get started with the concepts listed.

- [Stack Data Structure Guide](/docs/stack)
- [Queue Data Structure Guide](/docs/queue)

Remember: The best data structure is the one that solves your specific problem efficiently. Don't overcomplicate things - start simple and optimize when needed.
