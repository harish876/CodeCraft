# Introduction - CodeCraft Platform

Welcome, if this is your first tim at CodeCraft. This is a simple website to learn the basics of data structures, algorithms and advance your computer science journey.
This serves as a platform to gradually start from basic data structures and eventually reach more complex concepts as you move through your college career.

## How to use CodeCraft

I built this platform so that you can track your progression from a novice CS student to a person who has identified their interest. These concepts in my opinion are the gateway to understanding anything and more importantly foundational for getting a job, doing [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and the whole nine yards.
So what should you focus on when everything seems vast, AI seemingly does everything you want to.

- **Focus on the fundamentals**: Pick a coding language and build reps.
- Use CodeCraft as a hub to establish a **Mental Model** of all data structures you need in your back pocket.
- CodeCraft is just a **introduction** and a window into these concepts.
- Practice these questions, explore concepts in depth.
- Setup an **IDE**, or Integrated Development Environment to build off small examples and eventuall great software.

Remember: The best data structure is the one that solves your specific problem efficiently. Don't overcomplicate things - start simple and optimize when needed.
