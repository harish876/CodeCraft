# Queue Implementation using Linked List

## Why Linked List?
After understanding the array-based implementation of queues, we can see that linked lists offer several advantages:

1. **Dynamic Size**: No need to worry about fixed capacity or resizing
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Only allocate memory for elements that are actually in the queue
3. **No Memory Wastage**: Unlike arrays, we don't have unused space at the front
4. **No Resizing Overhead**: No need to copy elements when resizing

## Key Components

- **Node**: Each element in the queue is stored in a node containing:
  - Data: The actual value
  - Next: Reference to the next node
- **Front Pointer**: Points to the first node (for dequeue operations)
- **Rear Pointer**: Points to the last node (for enqueue operations)

## Key Operations

- **Enqueue**: Add a new node at the rear
- **Dequeue**: Remove the node at the front
- **Front/Peek**: View the front node's data
- **isEmpty**: Check if front pointer is null
- **Size**: Keep track of number of nodes

## Brief Introduction

## Interactive Playground

Try implementing a queue using a linked list! The playground below provides a template where you can code your own implementation. Please close the sidebar by clicking on the sidebar close icon to have a nicer coding experience.

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Enqueue   | O(1)            |
| Dequeue   | O(1)            |
| Front     | O(1)            |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            |
| Size      | O(1)            |

## Memory Management

1. **Allocation**: New nodes are created during enqueue
2. **Deallocation**: Nodes are removed during dequeue
3. **Memory Leaks**: Always properly delete nodes in C++
4. **Garbage Collection**: Handled automatically in Python/JavaScript

## Conclusion

In this section, we learned how to implement a queue using a singly linked list. We also learned about the time complexity of the operations and the memory management of the linked list. There are other types of queues like a circular queue, priority queue, double ended queue etc. which we will learn in future sections.
